# Web Design Part 2!

This is a repository with a skeleton for a webpage using various frameworks. This week we will be continuing our discussion on UI/UX as well as starting to talk about how to actually implement this as a website developer using HTML/CSS.


## Instructions
1. Start by forking [*this repository*](https://github.com/LeTourneau-ACM/web-intro) (click the button that says fork) so that you will have a custom version to work on. A fork is just a copy of a repository for you to edit. This forked repository belongs to you and is where you will do your work.

2. Now you want to clone **your repository** to your own computer in order to work on it.
   1. Open a command prompt or bash window where you want to work (maybe C:\\Documents?)
   2. **Copy your forked repository's URL**

   3. Type in `$ git clone your-repository-url.git`
   4. Now you can start working.

3. After we have made changes push it to your forked repository.
   1. Make sure your computer knows your git credentials:
      1. `$ git config user.name username`
      2. `$ git config user.email email`
   2. Then you can push your changes to your remote repository
   3. `$ git add problem.solution.lang`
   4. `$ git commit`
      1. This will open a window for you to edit your message in. Treat this like an email: brief header, larger body.
   5. `$ git push`
